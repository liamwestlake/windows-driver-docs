# Install the WDK using NuGet

This topic describes how to use NuGet to install the Windows Driver Kit on your computer. NuGet is a popular package manager, used for packaging and distributing software. For more information, see [What is NuGet?](/nuget/what-is-nuget/).

## Windows Drivers Kit Overview

Windows Driver Kit (WDK) is a software tool set used to develop, test and deploy Windows drivers. The content included in the WDK can be categorized into five unique types: Headers, Libraries, Samples, Tools and Templates.

The WDK is released in three different distributions, with different installation options.

**Windows Driver Kit (WDK)**: The WDK is available as a traditional msi based package. It requires Visual Studio to be installed and the WDK is installed to `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Windows Kits\`. See [Download the Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](.\download-the-wdk.md) for information on downloading and installing the WDK.

**Enterprise Windows Drivers Kit (EWDK)**: This is shipped as a standalone ISO, which includes the command line compiler build tools, the SDK and the WDK. The EWDK is a standalone self-contained command-line environment. To get started, just mount the ISO and run LaunchBuildEnv. Visit [Download the Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](.\download-the-wdk.md) for details on how to download and use the EWDK.

**Windows Drivers Kit NuGet Package**: The WDK NuGet package consists of essential libraries, headers, DLL, tools and metadata used for building Windows drivers that can be shared and supported by modern CI/CD pipelines. The official release of the WDK NuGet package is now available on nuget.org. The latest release version is *10.0.26100.1*. For information on the latest release of the WDK, SDK and Visual Studio, see [Kit versioning](./download-the-wdk.md#kit-versioning).

Users can access and consume the NuGet packages directly from nuget.org from within Visual Studio. Using NuGet with the WDK provides a lightweight solution for WDK acquisition for developers who need always up to date tools for building modern hardware drivers. For more information, see [Install and manage packages in Visual Studio using the NuGet Package Manager](/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio/).

The WDK NuGet packages are also available on the NuGet website.

ARM64: <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.WDK.ARM64>

### Directions for building drivers in automated build systems
